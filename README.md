# URaS.UseVR9000-Rpi-and-Spark-ToFixCleaningQualityEfficiency

I'm not entirely satisfied with Quality and Efficiency of vacuum level done by VR9000.

So I and my eight years old son will do a project to fix that ;)

Idea:

1. VR9k remote control(learn a few buttons, use IR transmitter to use maual mode)

2. Raspberry pi with camera and IR mode(casing, powering and soldering)

3. First, joystick via net to remotely controle VR9k, use all data we can collect to learn rooms, obstacles and controle

4. Second, Apache Spark to do all remotely and automaticlly, or maybe samething simpler


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


This project is done only for fun with my son.

TODO later:

+. avoid a dog or a cat food

+. move shoos or a small obstacle

+. avoid fluids

+. on remote mode is age sensor working?

+. maybe use broken Note 3 and Rpi?

   N3 has a IR transmitter

   nice counting power

   Rpi usb net to N3

   But Rpi as a starter ;) then N3 evo.

   Rpi:

      easy: video/picture streaming, joy streaming, first stage, different camera angles

      !easy: IR, counting power

   N3:

      easy: Java/Scala, IR, 

      !easy: camera only ceiling,
